<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
The Xrest framework provides two domain specific languages (DSLs) to simplify the development of REST style
web services. It was developped in the context of the Xbase Project, which was funded by the German Federal
Ministry of Education and Research under the grant number 01S10008, as an evalution theme for the Xbase
expression language. Xbase itself is distributed as part of <a href="http://www.xtext.org">Xtext</a> and can be
reused by any domain specific language developed with Xtext, where expressions are needed. The Xbase
language can be seen as a partial programming language, which only provides expressions and needs to
be embedded in some kind of structural language. In the Xrest framework two DSLs have been developed
to simplify the development of RESTful webservices.
</p>
<p>
The first DSL originates from the <a href="http://www.xtext.org">Xtext</a> domain model example for
modeling entities and their relations and generates RESTful web services, JPA entities and a data access layer. The
second DSL provides a simple way to declare and implement plain RESTful services. Both DSLs are compiled
to plain Java code. While the first, as it&apos;s producing <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=317">Java Persistence Api</a>
(JPA) entities and web services that rely on serializability of those, the domain model language depends
on the JPA library and also the <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=222">JAXB</a> framework, which solves
the serialization requirements. Both languages also use <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=339">JAX-RS</a>
for mapping HTTP methods to URLs and thus enable their usage as a RESTful web service.
</p>
<p>
In this document, the usage and implementation of both languages is described and a short <em>getting started</em>
guide is given. We start of with the getting started guide in <a href="02a-getting_started.html#getting_started" title="Go to &quot;Getting started with Xrest&quot;" >section getting_started</a> followed by a more
complete user guide of the domain model language in <a href="02-dmodel.html#dmodel" title="Go to &quot;The Domain Model Language&quot;" >section dmodel</a>. This is followed by a guide on how to
implement services in <a href="03-service.html#service" title="Go to &quot;Services&quot;" >section service</a>. Finally, the implementation of both languages is discussed in <a href="04-implementation.html#implementation" title="Go to &quot;Implementation of the Languages&quot;" >section implementation</a>.
