<h1>Implementation of the Languages</h1>
<p>
Both, the domain model as well as the service language, have been developed using the
<a href="http://www.xtext.org">Xtext languagedevelopment framework</a>. While the domain model language is originally
bundled with Xtext as an example, the service language was developed from scratch. In this section we
go into detail how both languages have been implemented.
